// SOLID principles:
// - The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that help
//   developers create maintainable and scalable software.
// - These principles were initially defined for object-oriented programming but are widely applicable, in TypeScript and other languages.
// - The SOLID acronym stands for:
//    - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
//    - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
//    - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
//    - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
//    - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
// - These principles help developers create code that is easy to maintain, extend, and test.
// - They also help developers avoid code smells, such as tight coupling,
//   code duplication, and fragile base class problems.
// - Let's take a look at each of the SOLID principles in TypeScript.
